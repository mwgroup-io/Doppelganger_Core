## Wiring Guide

> ⚠️ **POWER WARNING** ⚠️
> 
> - Only one 12V power source should be used at a time (either DC jack OR screw terminal)
> - USB-C and 12V power can be safely connected simultaneously
> - Always verify the correct polarity when using the screw terminal

### Power Connections
1. **12V DC Power Supply Options**
   - **Option 1: DC Power Jack**
     - Connect the 12V DC power supply to the 5.5x2.1mm DC power jack on the Doppelgänger board
   - **Option 2: 2-Pin Screw Terminal**
     - Alternatively, connect the 12V DC power supply to the included 2-pin screw terminal
   - The board will automatically regulate this down to 5V and 3.3V for internal use

2. **RFID Reader Power**
   - The Doppelgänger board provides a 12V DC pass-through connection for the RFID reader
   - Connect the reader's power input to the 12V DC output on the Doppelgänger board

### Wiegand Interface Connections
1. **Data Lines**
   - Connect the Green wire (Data0) from the RFID reader to the Data0 pin on the Doppelgänger board
   - Connect the White wire (Data1) from the RFID reader to the Data1 pin on the Doppelgänger board
   - Connect the Black wire (GND) from the RFID reader to any GND pin on the Doppelgänger board

2. **Power to RFID Reader**
   - Connect the Red wire (12V DC) from the Doppelgänger board to the RFID reader's power input
   - Connect the Black wire (GND) from the Doppelgänger board to the RFID reader's ground

## Updating Firmware

There are three supported ways to update the firmware on Doppelgänger Core.

### Option 1: Use prebuilt installers from Releases (recommended)

1. Download the latest installer for your OS from the Releases page: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mwgroup-io/Doppelganger_Core/releases)
2. Connect your ESP32-S3 board via USB.
3. Run the downloaded installer for your platform (file name similar to `core_firmware_<version>_<os>_<arch>`):
   - macOS: make executable and run
     ```bash
     chmod +x ./core_firmware_<version>_darwin_<arch>
     ./core_firmware_<version>_darwin_<arch>
     ```
   - Linux: make executable and run
     ```bash
     chmod +x ./core_firmware_<version>_linux_<arch>
     ./core_firmware_<version>_linux_<arch>
     ```
   - Windows: run the `.exe` file
4. Select the suggested ESP32 serial port when prompted and follow on-screen instructions.

Notes:
- On macOS, you may need to allow execution (System Settings > Privacy & Security) if the binary was quarantined. Alternatively:
  ```bash
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./core_firmware_<version>_darwin_<arch>
  ```
- USB drivers are typically not required for ESP32-S3; if needed, install the appropriate USB-to-serial driver for your OS.
- The updater automatically detects the product type and installs the appropriate firmware.

### Option 2: Build the updater locally (builder + flasher)

1. From the project root, run the updater build script:
   ```bash
   ./d_core_updater/build_binaries.sh
   # or with verbose logs
   ./d_core_updater/build_binaries.sh -v
   ```
2. After success, installers are located at:
   - `d_core_updater/build/installers_<version>_<timestamp>/`
3. Run the appropriate installer for your OS (same steps as in Option 1).

### Option 3: Manual update with PlatformIO (developer workflow)

1. Build the application and filesystem:
   ```bash
   platformio run --environment esp32-s3-devkitc-1
   platformio run --target buildfs --environment esp32-s3-devkitc-1
   ```
2. Upload the firmware and filesystem directly with PlatformIO:
   ```bash
   # Upload application
   platformio run --target upload --environment esp32-s3-devkitc-1
   # Upload filesystem (LittleFS)
   platformio run --target uploadfs --environment esp32-s3-devkitc-1
   ```
3. If you prefer using `esptool`, gather the generated binaries from `.pio/build/esp32-s3-devkitc-1/` and flash with these offsets:
   ```bash
   esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port <port> --baud 460800 \
     --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z \
     --flash_mode qio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 8MB \
     0x0000 bootloader.bin \
     0x8000 partitions.bin \
     0xE000 boot_app0.bin \
     0x10000 firmware.bin \
     0x670000 LittleFS.bin
   ```

Troubleshooting:
- Ensure the correct serial port is selected and not in use by another application.
- Try a different USB cable/port if the device is not detected.
- For persistent flashing issues, reduce baud to `115200` in `esptool.py` command.
